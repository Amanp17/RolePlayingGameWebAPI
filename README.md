## RESTful WEB-API using ASP.NET MVC and SQL SERVER


A role-playing game (RPG) is a genre of video game where the gamer controls a fictional character (or characters) that undertakes a quest in an imaginary world.

The back end application is a small text-based role-playing game where different users can register (Here we have used JSON web tokens for authentication) and create their 
own characters like a mage or a knight, also added some skills and a weapon, and also let the characters fight against each other to see who is the best of them all.
